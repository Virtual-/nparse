# Nomns' Parser for Project1999 Linux port.


Provides player location and spell tracking support for Project 1999 by reading the player log.

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/nomns/nparse/wiki) for more information or go to the [Releases](https://github.com/nomns/nparse/releases) for the latest release.

This is a form of Nomns parser in which i've changed a few paths to make it more linux friendly as I play P99 on Fedora Linux.

nparse directory must be in $HOME and named `nparse`, run `run.sh` from anywhere to make it run.
